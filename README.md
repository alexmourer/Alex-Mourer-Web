## Description

This website was created using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) JavaScript framework.

#### Why Vue.js?

First, and foremost, Vue.js is fun. It's an interesting JavaScript framework that allows for versatility in code structure, offers plenty of features out of the box, and provides great performance.

I will admit that it's a bit overkill for a largely static website like this one. My previous website was 8+ years old and built with WordPress. WordPress is great but I wanted to build something that was more in-line with my current web interests. I was between Vue.js and React but ultimately chose Vue due to its simplicity.

I also decided to add even more complexity by adding a headless CMS called [Kentico Cloud](https://kenticocloud.com/) into the mix.

Kentico Cloud allows the use of API calls to their server that will return JSON data to populate the site. [Here](https://deliver.kenticocloud.com/e75ce49a-4064-0098-b307-d687a6a064ab/items) is an example of the JSON data.
